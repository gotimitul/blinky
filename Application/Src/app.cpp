/* Application Main
 ---
 # üìù Overview
 The Application Main module initializes the application by setting up GPIO for
 the user button, creating LED control threads, and initializing the USB logger
 for debugging output.

 # ‚öôÔ∏è Features
 - Initializes GPIO for user button with event callback.
 - Creates multiple LED control threads.
 - Initializes USB logger for runtime logging.
 - Uses CMSIS-RTOS2 for threading and synchronization.

 # üìã Usage
 The application starts by calling the `app_main` function, which sets up the
 necessary components and then exits, allowing the LED threads to run
 independently.

 # üîß Implementation Details
 The `app_main` function is the entry point of the application. It configures
 the GPIO pin for the user button to trigger an event on a rising edge. It then
 initializes the USB logger if runtime logging is enabled. Four LED threads are
 created, each controlling a different colored LED. The function finally exits,
 allowing the RTOS to manage the threads.

 The GPIO event callback function `ARM_GPIO_SignalEvent` is defined to handle
 button press events. When the user button is pressed, it sets an event flag to
 notify the LED thread.

 The implementation uses static allocation for RTOS objects to ensure efficient
 memory usage and avoid dynamic allocation issues in embedded systems.

 It has been verified to handle concurrent logging from multiple threads and to
 replay logs correctly over USB.
