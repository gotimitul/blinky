/* Boot Clock
 ---
 # üìù Overview
 The Boot Clock module provides a way to keep track of system time since boot.
 It uses the RTOS tick count to calculate the elapsed time in hours, minutes,
 seconds, and milliseconds.

 # ‚öôÔ∏è Features
 - Retrieve current system time in a human-readable format.
 - Uses RTOS tick count for accurate timekeeping.

 # üìã Usage
 To use the Boot Clock module, obtain the singleton instance using
 `BootClock::getInstance()`. Call `getCurrentTimeString()` to get the current
 time as a formatted string.

 # üîß Implementation Details
 The BootClock class is implemented as a singleton to ensure a single instance
 throughout the application. It uses the CMSIS-RTOS2 API to get the system tick
 count and calculates the elapsed time. The time is formatted as "HH:MM:SS.mmm"
 where HH is hours, MM is minutes, SS is seconds, and mmm is milliseconds.
