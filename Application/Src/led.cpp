/* LED Control
 ---
 This module provides an interface for controlling LEDs connected to GPIO pins.

 # üìù Overview
 The LED control module allows for easy manipulation of LED states
 (on/off/toggle) through a simple API. It abstracts the underlying GPIO
 operations, providing a higher-level interface for LED control.

 # ‚öôÔ∏è Features
 - Turn LEDs on and off.
 - Toggle LED states.

 # üìã Usage
 To use the LED control module, create an instance of the `Led` class and call
 the desired methods (on, off, toggle) with the appropriate GPIO pin number.

 # üîß Implementation Details
 The `Led` class uses the CMSIS-compliant `ARM_DRIVER_GPIO` interface to
 manipulate GPIO pins. The `toggle` method reads the current state of the pin
 and sets it to the opposite state.

 The implementation ensures that the GPIO driver is properly initialized and
 configured before performing any operations.
